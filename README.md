| Once we had an efficient way of comunicating we had great communication | Meeting planning | Establish a more routine time to meet with the team |
| Met in person at library and capstone room | Library room was very small, Capstone room is other side of campus for all members | Establish meeting place at appropriate sized library room or house |
| Used a discord for online meet ups and updates  | Distribution of workload could have been better| As early as possible, discuss the distribution of work and make sure everyone starts early to improve timing |
