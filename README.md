## Overview

Currently working on the basis of our project by creating use case diagrams based on our user requirments and doing research on viable web development stacks to use for our messanger application.


## System Analysis

### User Requirements

List user requirements of the project that the team will develop into use cases in later steps.

- A user can register for access 
- A user can login 
- A user can logout
- A logged in user can send a message
- A logged in user can recieve a message
- An unregistered user cannot send or recieve messages

### Use Cases

</p>

Draw the overview use case diagram, and define brief use case description for each use case.

### Use Case Description

- An unregistered user will be able to register and become a registered user but will not be able to send or receive messages while unregistered.

- Once a user is registered they will be able to login, logout, send, and receive messages.
